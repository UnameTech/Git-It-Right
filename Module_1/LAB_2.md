##  **Life of a File in Git: Explained Step-by-Step**

###  Project Directory: `my_project_A`
This is your working directory where the file lives and changes begin.

---

###  **Step 1: File is Created – "Untracked" State**

- You create a new file called `file1` inside `my_project_A`.

```bash
touch file1
```

- Git does **not know about this file yet**. It is in the **"Untracked"** state.

```bash
git status
```
 Output:
```
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	file1
```

---

###  **Step 2: git add – Move to "Staging Area"**

```bash
git add file1
```

- The `git add` command **moves the file to the Staging Area**.
- This is like telling Git: _“I’m ready to commit this version of the file.”_

🧠 Git takes a **snapshot** of `file1` and stores it temporarily in the Staging Area (also known as the Index).

```bash
git status
```
 Output:
```
Changes to be committed:
	new file:   file1
```

 At this stage, your file is prepared to be committed — it’s not in the Git repository yet.

---

###  **Step 3: git commit – Move to Git Repository**

```bash
git commit -m "Added file1"
```

- This command **moves `file1` from the Staging Area into the actual Git repository**.
- Now, the file becomes a **permanent part of Git history** (a new commit is created).
- Git stores this version in its `.git` database as part of a **commit object**.

 Output:
```
[main (root-commit) abc1234] Added file1
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(+)
 create mode 100644 file1
```

---

##  Behind the Scenes in `.git`

- Once committed, `file1` now resides in the Git repo history.
- `.git` stores:
  - **Object database**: your commit, blob (file content), tree (directory info)
  - **Commit history**, pointers (HEAD, branches), etc.

---

##  Recap Based on the Diagram

```
file1
 ↓              (git add)
Staging Area
 ↓              (git commit -m "message")
Git Repository (.git)
```

- **Untracked**: Git has no knowledge of the file.
- **Staging Area**: File is tracked but not committed yet.
- **Git Repo**: File is committed, versioned, and stored permanently.

##  Real-World Analogy

| Git Phase       | Analogy                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Untracked       | A draft on your desk             |
| Staging Area    | Putting the draft in your "To File" tray |
| Git Repository  | Filing it in a cabinet (official record) |

---
---

---

##  **1. What is the Untracked Area?**

- The **Untracked Area** means:
  - Git sees the file exists in your working directory
  - But **Git is not tracking any changes** to it yet

 Think of it like:  
> “This file is in the folder, but Git doesn’t care about it yet.”

###  How to Identify:
```bash
git status
```
You’ll see something like:
```
Untracked files:
  file1
```

---

##  **2. What is the Staging Area?**

- The **Staging Area** (also called the **Index**) is a **middle space** between the working directory and the Git repository.
- When you run `git add`, the file is moved into the staging area.
- Git takes a **snapshot of the file’s current state** and holds it there, preparing for the next commit.

 Think of it like:
> “A clipboard where Git temporarily holds files before filing them into history.”

###  How to View Staged Files:
```bash
git status
```
```
Changes to be committed:
  new file: file1
```

---

##  **3. What is the Git Repo (Local Repository)?**

- The **Git repository** is where all **committed versions** of your files are stored.
- This includes:
  - Your commit history
  - All file snapshots
  - Metadata (like author, date, message)
- It's located inside the hidden `.git` folder in your project.

 Think of it like:
> “A time machine that stores every version of every file you've committed.”

---

##  Is the File Available in All 3 Areas?

No, **not simultaneously in full form**. Here’s how it works:

| Git Area        | Contains | File Physically Present? | Comment |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------------|---------|
| **Untracked**   | Just in working directory |  Yes | Git doesn’t track it |
| **Staging Area**| Snapshot for next commit   |  Internally staged (not another copy) | Temporary metadata |
| **Git Repo**    | Permanent snapshot (commit) |  As a compressed object | Stored in `.git` |

So:

- When untracked → file only exists in working directory
- When staged → Git adds a snapshot (not duplicate file)
- When committed → Git stores a version inside `.git` as a **blob object**

---

###  Lifecycle Summary:

1. `file1` created → **Untracked**
2. `git add file1` → **Staged**
3. `git commit -m "msg"` → **Committed to Git Repo**

---

###  Real Storage Insight

- File in **working directory** → Real file you see and edit
- File in **staging area** → Staged version recorded by Git internally
- File in **repository** → Stored as compressed blobs and commits in `.git/objects`

#  Explore `.git/objects/` — See How Git Stores Files

After you've added and committed a file, Git creates **objects** (blobs, trees, commits) and stores them in the `.git/objects/` directory.

Let’s go through a **step-by-step lab** to visualize this:

---

##  Step-by-Step Lab to Explore `.git/objects/`

###  Step 1: Create a New Git Project

```bash
mkdir deep_git_demo && cd deep_git_demo
git init
```

---

###  Step 2: Create and Add a File

```bash
echo "This is a secret" > file1.txt
git add file1.txt
```

At this stage, Git has **staged** the file but not committed it yet.

---

###  Step 3: Commit the File

```bash
git commit -m "Add file1.txt"
```

Now Git will:
- Create a **blob** for the file content
- Create a **tree** for directory structure
- Create a **commit** object pointing to the tree

---

###  Step 4: Explore the `.git/objects` Directory

```bash
ls -R .git/objects
```

You’ll see something like:

```
.git/objects/
  info
  pack
  ab/
    cdef1234567890...
  cd/
    0987abcdef1234...
```

These are **Git objects** (the actual file data is stored here compressed and hashed).

---

###  Step 5: List All Git Objects

```bash
git cat-file -t <object-hash>  # To check type (blob, tree, commit)
git cat-file -p <object-hash>  # To print contents
```

 Get a commit hash:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Then try:
```bash
git cat-file -t <commit_hash>
git cat-file -p <commit_hash>
```

And explore further:
- Inside the commit you’ll see the **tree hash**
- Use that tree hash to view:
  ```bash
  git cat-file -p <tree_hash>
  ```

Then from the tree output, get the **blob hash** and run:
```bash
git cat-file -p <blob_hash>
```

 This will show your original file content:
```
This is a secret
```

---

##  Summary of Object Types

| Git Object | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **blob**   | Stores actual file contents |
| **tree**   | Directory structure (file names → blob hashes) |
| **commit** | Snapshot pointer + message + author + parent |

---

##  Visual Flow

```
.git/objects/
├── [blob] file1.txt contents (compressed)
├── [tree] tracks file name and mode
└── [commit] links to the tree and saves message, metadata
```
